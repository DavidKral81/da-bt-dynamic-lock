# Changelog

What changed between releases, newest first. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); the project uses
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

The version itself lives in `windows/version.py` — one constant the app, the
installer, both `.exe` resources and the APK all read. Change it there and
nowhere else.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Both apps now show their version next to a link to the releases page, so
  updating no longer needs a cable: on the phone the browser downloads the APK
  and installs it over the existing app. Neither app talks to the network by
  itself — the link is handed to the browser, and you compare the version you
  see with the one on the page. The phone app still has no `INTERNET`
  permission.

### Changed

- The language is switched with flags in the top right corner — in the app,
  the installer and the uninstaller alike. The drop-down in the settings is
  gone: one setting, one control. A flag also stays readable for someone who
  installed the app in a language they cannot read.

## 1.0 — 18 Aug 2026

First public release.

### Added

- Locks Windows when the watched Bluetooth LE device goes out of range, and a
  companion Android app that keeps the phone broadcasting.
- Live chart of the signal strength, from 2 minutes up to a whole day.
- Countdown window before locking, an idle guard, a temporary pause and a
  warning when the device stops being heard at all.
- Czech and English throughout, including the installer and the phone app.
- One program in both roles, installer and uninstaller; autostart through a
  Task Scheduler task the app creates itself.
